# Evolutionary Game
A game where agents control objects in an obstacle-filled environment. The agents are controlled by neural networks, and each generation consists of multiple objects.Through evolution using weighted selection, crossover, and mutation, the agentsâ€™ neural networks improve over generations to enhance obstacle avoidance skills and maximize their survival in the game.
# Game Modes
The game has three different modes with different characteristics and objects.
| Helicopter  | Gravity | Thrust |
